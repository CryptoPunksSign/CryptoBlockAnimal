## CryptoPunks: a crypto block animal, created by on-chain transactions.

This is a Generative Transfer Art project, building off of GTAP1. When you mint an animal, it will be randomly assigned one of six possible types. To begin, the NFT image will be blank. The first four times the NFT is transferred, a color is filled in based on the recipient's address. On the fourth transfer, the Animal's mood is revealed - the coloring and animation of its eyes. The 10x10 SVG art and animation are generated and stored entirely on-chain. See them on OpenSea (filter for fully colored).
